      <description>During this cool Christmas day, Santa Claus brings us lot of presents (I hope for you), I received 2 RaspberryPi Zero, Thx you brother ;-). I will show you a cool stuff after this special day. We gonna test how to use Rhiot project into Kura Eclipse Platform running inside Docker container deployed into a real RaspberryPi Zero device (in this order). If you don&amp;rsquo;t have yet a RaspberryPi (B+, 2 or zero) device you can use my previous post.</description>

      <description>Rhiot project decides recently to support mainly Kura Eclipse Platform. Our project will provides some code and extension for Kura like Camel integration and lots of other stuff. We have some new Camel component dedicated for Kura Platform (gpio, cloud, wifi). We want use this platform because it is OSGi compliant sotfware, focused to IoT universe, supported by Eclipse Foundation and Eurotech. Kura runs on RaspberryPi, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t have yet a RaspberryPi device we will show how to run Kura into Docker.</description>

      <description>Last week, Wildfly community has just released Wildfly 9.0.0.Final and I wrote a post about enabling HTTP2 into Wildlfy via the offline command line. Today, we will see how to do it with a Docker container. Docker container simplifies lot of thing when we need to deploy middleware infrastructure. I love this technology, because it is an Open Source project, it provides lot of command line stuff, the build process is awesome and run process is very easy ;-).</description>
