      <description>Last week, Wildfly community has just released Wildfly 9.0.0.Final and I wrote a post about enabling HTTP2 into Wildlfy via the offline command line. Today, we will see how to do it with a Docker container. Docker container simplifies lot of thing when we need to deploy middleware infrastructure. I love this technology, because it is an Open Source project, it provides lot of command line stuff, the build process is awesome and run process is very easy ;-).</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Wildfly community has just released Wildfly 9.0.0.Final, the last Application Server version. As I talked on my previous French post about Wildfly they are a lot of new cool stuffs. I noticed two of them we could use both together quickly. Into a datacenter, we want setup the first configuration without startup full process and open unnecessary port. I propose in this post to setup HTTP/2 with offline mode, it is quite useful because we could want to start a JBoss instance directly with HTTP/2 protocol enabled.</description>
