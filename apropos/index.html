Greg. (alias Grégoire) - I am a Solution Architect at AWS WWPS. My role involves assisting customers in understanding technologies, adopting AWS services, integrating new processes, and transforming their organizations. I specialize in crafting solutions based on Cloud, Modern Applications, AI/LLM integration and Automation technologies, leveraging both the Cloud stack and the spirit of Open Source.
I thrive on building relationships with decision-makers and serving as the customer&rsquo;s technical point of contact. Educating prospects on product implementation and usage is among my responsibilities. Fueled by the Open Source mindset, I have actively participated in various projects involving Cloud Solutions, GenAI/LLM, RAG/MCP solutions, Kubernetes tech, Java/NodeJS/Python, Business Automation, and Rule Engine technologies.
