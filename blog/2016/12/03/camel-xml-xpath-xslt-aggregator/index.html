<p>Here is the XSLT Aggregator for merging the pre-call service message with the new message returned from the service. By default, Camel passes the original message to the XSLT processor and adds the new message as an XSLT parameter named <code>new-exchange</code>.</p>
<p>The XSL transformation uses an identity algorithm to copy all elements from the previous message (in the first <code>xsl:template</code> block) and then applies specific transformations when needed (in the second <code>xsl:template</code> block). This approach allows for selective merging of data while preserving the overall structure.</p>

<p>The Camel framework is highly versatile and enjoyable to work with. Its flexibility provides significant leverage when implementing complex integration scenarios in real-world applications. The <code>XsltAggregationStrategy</code> enables you to work with XML throughout the entire Camel route, maintaining data integrity and structure.</p>
<p>Using Camel routes as services offers tremendous advantages for creating more adaptable development environments, as you can reuse services whenever needed. However, it&rsquo;s essential to keep in mind XML schema validation (for both input and output messages) and proper versioning management to ensure long-term maintainability.</p>
