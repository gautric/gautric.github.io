Kura is an OSGi Platform designed specifically for IoT, capable of running on RaspberryPi, BeagleBone, or Intel Edison devices.\nThe Kura Platform comes with many embedded services tailored for IoT contexts, including GPIO, USB, I2C, Cloud Service, and more. In this post, we will explore:\nHow to use Kura Rhiot Quickstart in both emulator mode and real-life mode.\nRequisites Eclipse Mars Linux or Mac only for emulation One RaspberryPi tested w/ RPi B+ Two LEDs Two Resistors Wires Kura Setup Emulator setup First of all, you have to setup your Eclipse workspace with the Kura eclipse workspace available for download. Just follow the instructions strictly.\nWarning\nTo avoid any compilation problems, please downgrade your JRE to a 1.7 version\nInfo\nYou can test and configure your workspace with the Heater Demo Project\nCamel and Rhiot configuration into Emulator Target Definition configuration Before setting up Camel and Rhiot into the Kura Emulator, you need to download several Java libraries:\ncamel-core-2.16.0.jar From ASF Camel camel-core-osgi-2.16.0.jar From ASF Camel camel-kura-2.16.0.jar From ASF Camel camel-kura-0.1.3-SNAPSHOT.jar From Rhiot Project Camel After downloading, create a new folder in the target-definition project like camel/2.16.0 and copy all previously downloaded libraries into it.\nOpen the Target Definition panel and Add... a new Installation mapped to the new camel/2.16.0 folder.\nVerify that Target Content loads the Camel and Rhiot libraries correctly by clicking on the Content tab to check.\nSave the configuration and click the Set as Target Definition action (top right).\nLaunch configuration We have just finished setting up the Target Definition stack. Now we will see how to run it with the Launch command.\nEdit it and select the correct libraries once again.\nTo check the installation, just run the Launch command as usual and check bundles loading via the OSGi ss command.\nosgi\u003e ss | grep camel 39\tACTIVE org.apache.camel.camel-core_2.16.0 47\tACTIVE org.apache.camel.camel-core-osgi_2.16.0 58\tACTIVE org.apache.camel.camel-kura_2.16.0 61\tACTIVE io.rhiot.camel-kura_0.1.3.SNAPSHOT true osgi\u003e Cool everything looks good to run our example!\nTest and run Kura Rhiot quickstart in emulator Import Quickstart Sample Download our Kura Rhiot quickstart directly from the GitHub repository.\nChange the GatewayRouter class with:\nGatewayRouter contains our Camel route as usual. It is an OSGi Service. Change the GatewayRouter.xml file with:\nThis OSGi file is needed to start the GatewayRouter service with the Service Component Runtime mechanism, as we use SCR and not BundleActivation.\nChange the io.rhiot.quickstarts.kura.camel.GatewayRouter.xml file with:\nThis last file provides configuration attributes used by the GatewayRouter route, such as camel.kura.gpio.ouput.id.\nCompile via Maven using mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true to regenerate some MANIFEST and OSGi stuff via the Bnd Maven plugin.\nYou can also checkout the remote branch https://github.com/rhiot/quickstarts/tree/kura-gpio.\nEmulator run Use Kura_Emulator_OSX Eclipse to run Equinox OSGi.\nMake a small log4j modification in the ${loc_workspace}/org.eclipse.kura.emulator/src/main/resources/log4j.properties file:\n## eclipse log4j.logger.org.eclipse.kura.emulator.position=INFO log4j.logger.org.eclipse=WARN log4j.logger.io.rhiot=DEBUG log4j.logger.org.eclipse.kura.emulator.gpio=DEBUG log4j.logger.org.apache.camel=INFO log4j.logger.org.apache.camel.core.osgi=INFO The output should look like this:\nSLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.

As we’ve demonstrated today, the setup is not overly complex if you understand what you’re doing. I appreciate OSGi technology for its modularity, flexibility, and robustness.\nSince we can successfully integrate Camel and Rhiot bundles, we have the opportunity to develop exciting new components, applications, and products. This integration opens up numerous possibilities for IoT development on resource-constrained devices like the RaspberryPi.\nI encourage you to develop and contribute more to the Kura, Camel, and Rhiot projects. The combination of these technologies creates a powerful platform for IoT development that balances performance with flexibility.\nStay tuned for more updates and tutorials!\nPlease feel free to send me your feedback - see Apropos.\nUseful links KuraGateway configuration Rhiot project Camel-kura component ",

  <div class="post-content"><p>For a while, I have been developing during my free time for the <a href="http://rhiot.io">Rhiot project</a> with my Red Hat colleague <a href="http://henryk-konsek.blogspot.fr/">Henryk</a>. We started by developing several <a href="http://camel.apache.org/components.html#Components-ExternalComponents">Camel components</a> such as kura, pi4j, and bluetooth with other volunteers. Now we are focusing on developing and integrating these components for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/kura/">Kura Platform</a>. Kura is an <a href="http://www.osgi.org">OSGi Platform</a> designed specifically for IoT, capable of running on RaspberryPi, BeagleBone, or Intel Edison devices.</p>
<p>The Kura Platform comes with many embedded services tailored for IoT contexts, including GPIO, USB, I2C, Cloud Service, and more. In this post, we will explore:</p>

<p>Before setting up Camel and Rhiot into the Kura Emulator, you need to download several Java libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>camel-core-2.16.0.jar
<ul>
<li>From <a href="http://camel.apache.org">ASF Camel</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>camel-core-osgi-2.16.0.jar
<ul>
<li>From <a href="http://camel.apache.org">ASF Camel</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>camel-kura-2.16.0.jar
<ul>
<li>From <a href="http://camel.apache.org">ASF Camel</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>camel-kura-0.1.3-SNAPSHOT.jar
<ul>
<li>From <a href="http://rhiot.io">Rhiot Project Camel</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After downloading, create a new folder in the <code>target-definition</code> project like <code>camel/2.16.0</code> and copy all previously downloaded libraries into it.</p>
<img src="/img/kura-camel-rhiot-1.png" style="max-width:33%;" />
<p>Open the Target Definition panel and <code>Add...</code> a new <code>Installation</code> mapped to the new <code>camel/2.16.0</code> folder.</p>
<img src="/img/kura-camel-rhiot-2.png" style="max-width:100%;" />
<p>Verify that <code>Target Content</code> loads the Camel and Rhiot libraries correctly by clicking on the <code>Content</code> tab to check.</p>
<img src="/img/kura-camel-rhiot-3.png" style="max-width:100%;" />
<p>Save the configuration and click the <code>Set as Target Definition</code> action (top right).</p>
<h4 id="launch-configuration">Launch configuration<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#launch-configuration">#</a></h4>
<p>We have just finished setting up the <code>Target Definition</code> stack. Now we will see how to run it with the <code>Launch</code> command.</p>
<img src="/img/kura-camel-rhiot-4.png" style="max-width:33%;" />
<img src="/img/kura-camel-rhiot-5.png" style="max-width:33%;" />
<p>Edit it and select the correct libraries once again.</p>
<img src="/img/kura-camel-rhiot-6.png" style="max-width:100%;" />
<p>To check the installation, just run the <code>Launch</code> command as usual and check bundles loading via the OSGi <code>ss</code> command.</p>

<p>Download our <a href="https://github.com/rhiot/quickstarts/tree/master/kura-camel">Kura Rhiot quickstart directly from the GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Change the <code>GatewayRouter</code> class with:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/gautric/e478b4b28b40c8270257.js"></script>
<p><code>GatewayRouter</code> contains our Camel route as usual. It is an OSGi Service. Change the <code>GatewayRouter.xml</code> file with:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/gautric/2134986bb6114b035cd5.js"></script>
<p>This OSGi file is needed to start the GatewayRouter service with the <a href="https://osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.1.0/scr.xsd">Service Component Runtime</a> mechanism, as we use SCR and not BundleActivation.</p>
<p>Change the <code>io.rhiot.quickstarts.kura.camel.GatewayRouter.xml</code> file with:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/gautric/052adb5b2acf1b96c3cc.js"></script>
<p>This last file provides configuration attributes used by the <code>GatewayRouter</code> route, such as <code>camel.kura.gpio.ouput.id</code>.</p>
<p>Compile via Maven using <code>mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true</code> to regenerate some MANIFEST and OSGi stuff via the Bnd Maven plugin.</p>
<p>You can also checkout the remote branch <code>https://github.com/rhiot/quickstarts/tree/kura-gpio</code>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/kura/">Kura Platform</a> is a truly interesting OSGi Platform. As we&rsquo;ve demonstrated today, the setup is not overly complex if you understand what you&rsquo;re doing. I appreciate OSGi technology for its modularity, flexibility, and robustness.</p>
<p>Since we can successfully integrate Camel and Rhiot bundles, we have the opportunity to develop exciting new components, applications, and products. This integration opens up numerous possibilities for IoT development on resource-constrained devices like the RaspberryPi.</p>
<p>I encourage you to develop and contribute more to the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/kura/">Kura</a>, <a href="http://camel.apache.org">Camel</a>, and <a href="http://rhiot.io">Rhiot</a> projects. The combination of these technologies creates a powerful platform for IoT development that balances performance with flexibility.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates and tutorials!</p>
<p>Please feel free to send me your feedback - see <a href="/apropos/">Apropos</a>.</p>
